# Aptos Kudos Board üöÄ

## Description

**Aptos Kudos Board** is a decentralized full-stack application built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to send and receive appreciation tokens (kudos) on-chain. Each kudo is stored as an immutable transaction on the blockchain, creating a permanent record of recognition and gratitude within communities.

The application features a complete Move smart contract backend with a modern React frontend, demonstrating real-world blockchain interaction patterns including wallet integration, transaction submission, and on-chain data retrieval.
